# Brewing-system
Brewing system used for controlling the flow of water and wort based on temperatures and recipe / grainbill. Flow sensors, temperature sensors, solenoids and an Arduino Mega are involved. 

# Automated Homebrewing System

This project is an **Arduino-based brewing controller** for automating the main steps of a homebrewing process.  
It uses solenoid valves, temperature sensors, and relays to control heating, water flow, and transfers between vessels.  

## Features
- Automatic heating of strike water  
- Transfer of strike water to mash tun  
- Mash temperature monitoring  
- Sparging with calculated water volume  
- Wort collection in the boil kettle  
- Manual control during the boil (heat applied manually)  
- Automated transfer to fermenter and cooling water control  

## Hardware
- Arduino (MKR / Uno / Mega, depending on setup)  
- Solenoid valves (6 total)  
  - S1: Fill mash water  
  - S2: Strike water to mash tun  
  - S3: Sparge water from heater  
  - S4: Wort to boil kettle  
  - S5: Wort to fermenter  
  - S6: Cooling water  
- Temperature sensors (3 total)  
  - T1: Hot liquor tank  
  - T2: Mash tun  
  - T3: Boil kettle  
- Relay module for heating element (optional / manual in current version)  
- Flow sensor for volume control (450 pulses/L)  

## Software
- Written in Arduino C++  
- Uses state machine logic to step through brewing stages automatically  
- Serial monitor currently used for logging (EEPROM planned for recipe logging)  

## Roadmap
- [ ] Save brew logs to EEPROM / SD card  
- [ ] Add web interface for remote monitoring (ESP32)  
- [ ] Automatic boil temperature control  
- [ ] Recipe input via JSON or buttons  

## How to Use
1. Upload the code to your Arduino.  
2. Connect all sensors and solenoids as described in `wiring.md` (to be added).  
3. Start the system ‚Äì it will automatically run through the main brewing steps.  
4. Monitor process via Serial Monitor.
